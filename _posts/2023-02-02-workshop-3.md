# Workshop 3: Finalizing the Ethics in AI/ML Modules
We're excited to announce that our 3rd and final workshop will be held on **13 February, 2023** from **10:00 to 16:00 ET**. If you'd like to join, please [contact us](mailto:kvrouwenvelder@agu.org)!

## Meeting objectives
As we move into 2023, we are working on a timeline for finalizing the Principles and Responsibilities in AI/ML and associated modules. 
We're excited with the shape this project has taken. We have received a number of responses to our request for feedback on the draft through both our online feedback form and our Town Hall at AGU's 2022 Fall Meeting. 
Our next step is now to incorporate that feedback into a final draft. 
During this workshop, we will be discussing the feedback received and working towards finalizing the document. 
In the next week, we'll be sharing a detailed agenda and plan for the workshop here, plus a document detailing the feedback we've received so far.

## Joining the meeting 
**Meeting time**: 10:00 to 16:00 ET on 13 February 2023.
We will be meeting virtually. A meeting recording will be shared after the workshop for those who are unable to attend. To join the meeting, please [contact us](mailto:kvrouwenvelder@agu.org) for the Zoom link.
