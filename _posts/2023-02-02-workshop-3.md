# Workshop 3: Finalizing the Ethics in AI/ML Modules
Our 3rd and final workshop was held virtually on **13 February, 2023** from **10:00 to 16:00 ET**. Thank you to all who attended for their comments and feedback on the draft Principles and Responsibilities document!

## Meeting Agenda
As we move into 2023, we are working on a timeline for finalizing the Principles and Responsibilities in AI/ML and associated modules. 
We received a number of responses to our request for feedback on the draft through both our online feedback form and our Town Hall at AGU's 2022 Fall Meeting, and worked to incorporate these comments into the draft Principles and Responsibilities during Workshop 3. 
Our next step is now to incorporate that feedback into a final draft.
