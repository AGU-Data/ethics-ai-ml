# Development of Principles and Responsibilities
As the culmination of our editorial team's work – and following the input and guidance gathered from our survey and Workshop 1 and Workshop 2 – we're happy to announce that a draft of our Principles and Responsibilities for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning ethics in the Earth, space, and environmental science is now available for comment!

We're excited to open up the document for feedback and comments. Please read the document here and give feedback through the form linked here. 

We look forward to hearing from you!
