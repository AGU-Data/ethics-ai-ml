**AGU AI/ML Ethics Workshop Goals and Designs**

Workshop 1:  
- Current State Assessment and Working Group Formation
- July 5-6, 2022

**Workshop 1 Goals:**
- Appreciate current AGU research ethics policy
- Review the current state on AI/ML ethics in research
- Review AI/ML ethics stakeholder “pulse” survey data
- Review selected case examples of AI/ML research with ethical implications
- Establish AI/ML ethics working groups 
- Conduct a “pre-mortem” to anticipate what could possibly go wrong
- Anticipate next steps for Workshop 2

**Workshop 1, Day 1:**
12:00	Welcome and Overview
12:15	Overview of current AGU research ethics policy
- Billy Williams, AGU
12:30	Lighting talks on current state of AI/ML ethics in research
- Abigail Azari, University of California, Berkeley
- David Gagne, University Corporation for Atmospheric Research 
- Thomas Donaldson, University of Pennsylvania
1:15	Anticipating results from AI/ML ethics stakeholder “pulse” survey data
1:30	Dialogue on gaps and issues
1:45	Break
2:00 	Brainstorming themes for working groups, potentially including:
- Working Group 1:  Transparency/Reporting:  Transparency/reporting on uncertainties with AI/ML ethics in research
- Working Group 2:  Replicability/Explainability:  Ensuring replicability/explainability with AI/ML ethics in research
- Working Group 3:  Risk/Bias/Impacts:  Identifying risks, bias, and unintended consequences with AI/ML ethics in research
- Working Group 4:  Outreach/Training/Leading Practices:  Collecting innovations in training, professional development, and outreach at all career stages
- Working Group 5:  TBD  

**2:30	Breakout groups by themes**
- Introductions (30 seconds each) (7-10 min.)
- What is “in” for this topic? What is “not in” for this topic? (15-20 min.)
- Mission statement/vision for your working group (20-30 min.)
3:30	Working Group reports
4:00 	Adjourn  

**Workshop 1, Day 2:**
10:00	Welcome, Overview, and Check-in
10:30	Case example 1:  Christine Kirkpatrick and Kevin Coakley, San Diego Supercomputing Center, with Discussion
10:50	Case example 2:  Yuhan Douglas Rao, North Carolina Institute for Climate Studies, with Discussion 
11:10	Case example 3:  Micaela Parker, Academic Data Science Alliance, with Discussion
11:30	Ethical Language that is Interoperable and Extensible
12:00	Lunch Break
12:30 	Working groups
•	Brainstorming on potential elements of recommended language (20-30 min.)
•	“Testing” potential recommended language against case examples (10-15 min.)
•	Organizing work between session I and session II (10-15 min.)
1:30	Pre-mortem (what could possibly go wrong?)
1:45	Next steps prep for Workshop 2 
2:00 	Adjourn
